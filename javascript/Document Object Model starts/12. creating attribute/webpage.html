<p>But today grayscale images (such as photographs) intended for visual display (both on screen and printed) are commonly stored with 8 bits per sampled pixel. This pixel depth allows 256 different intensities (i.e., shades of gray) to be recorded, and also simplifies computation as each pixel sample can be accessed </p>

<h2>heading two</h2>
<p> Oct 20, 2014 - 8 bits of data gives you 256 different storage combinations because 256 is 2^8 which means 8 bits of data, with each bit having 2 possible values, will give you 256 possible combinations that the 8 bits as whole can be in. This means you can distinguish between 256 different levels of grey in each pixel if</p>
